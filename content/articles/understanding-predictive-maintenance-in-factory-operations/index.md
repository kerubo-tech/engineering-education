### Introduction
In every production industry, equipment breakdowns or even downtime can cause huge losses to the organization. Predictive maintenance tracks assets' health, status, and performance in real-time. The aim is to reduce costs by foreseeing unexpected breakdowns, thus offering the manufacturer to schedule maintenance.

[Machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence) are used to detect flaws and failure patterns in the data produced by these assets. Most of them are fitted with [sensors](https://www.electronicshub.org/different-types-sensors/) and [IoT](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/IoT-device) devices that produce huge data streams. Detecting flaws in these assets is not easy. However, it becomes easy to predict and even schedule maintenance with the right AI algorithms coupled with better machine learning models.

It is possible to have the same type of equipment in manufacturing operations. However, they generate different data patterns and may need unique calibration and diagnosis. Sensors that detect heat may not necessarily work well during the cold season or may lose their sensitivity during these extreme conditions. The challenge arises to determine which data to use to diagnose the problem in given manufacturing equipment. The process tends to be more time-consuming and tedious as it involves iterations between the data streams produced. The challenge is even faced by most advanced firms that use AI and machine learning applications to deliver consistent results.

According to statistics, despite the challenges faced, predictive maintenance remains the most funded use case in Artificial Intelligence across all the manufacturing industries. The reason is to save costs and reduce downtimes and failures. Machine learning and AI are best suited for complex pattern recognition for predictive maintenance.

This article will highlight the business value predictive maintenance offers, the data and data processing involved, and business outcomes and changes of workflows involved.

### The value of predictive maintenance
With predictive maintenance, the manufacturing firm can determine the piece of equipment that is going to fail systematically. This assists in reducing the risk involved in using low-quality or faulty products that can be damaging compared to the cost of replacing the faulty equipment. The main challenge the manufacturers have to deal with is that the faulty equipment has to be shut down for maintenance, which may adversely affect other equipment and the personnel using it. Also, another challenge arises as the customers' expectations cannot be met without working machinery.

Also, some equipment, such as capital equipment, is costly to acquire and can take a long time to assemble and ship. However, predictive maintenance can ensure that the production line is not shut down while waiting for the equipment to be delivered. It is with no doubt that monetary savings in any company are critical, but using predictive maintenance when planning is more valuable. A machine learning model can be designed to notify the company in advance when the equipment may need maintenance or even replacing. This information can be valuable to the company as it allows them to budget in advance and makes informed expenditures.

The manufacturing firms should plan for consistent regiments of maintenance of the most critical equipment to avoid the impact caused by the failure of such equipment. Artificial Intelligence plays an essential role in reducing downtime and improving overall maintenance and equipment monitoring. This dramatically reduces the risk involved and improves the throughput of the manufacturing operations.

### How predictive maintenance can be implemented
Predictive maintenance requires the company to determine the success criteria for particular equipment. The data can be like the dimensions accuracy of the equipment and how it can change as the equipment wears and tears. A [machine learning model](https://www.sas.com/en_gb/insights/articles/analytics/a-guide-to-predictive-analytics-and-machine-learning.html) or an [AI algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-machine-learning-for-predictive-maintenance-4633cdbe4860) can be created with this kind of data. The data collected on that particular equipment determines the accuracy of the maintenance schedule that will be predicted by the model or the algorithm created.

In simple terms, the data collected from particular equipment form the training data fed into the algorithm. The script is then changed after a certain period, and the result is fed into the company's ERP system through the API. The success of an algorithm highly depends on the amount of data fed. As a rule of thumb, the more the data is fed, the better the algorithm will be. More recently collected data from the equipment should be used to reflect the machine's current performance.

### Applying monitoring settings to improve quality of product
The goal of predictive maintenance is to check on the settings of given equipment instead of logging the outcome. However, it is possible to check the outcome and associate it with the final product quality to given equipment settings. For instance, we can think of a steel company where we can have a process where the steel is bathed in acid to remove the rust. If the equipment is degraded, the temperature can be slightly lower, and rough spots may not be removed. In this case, a quality engineer would have to recalibrate the settings.

Factories that use the inbuilt sensors in their manufacturing machinery can have as many data points as possible. Therefore their machine learning algorithms are more effective. Machine learning in monitoring settings is valuable. It widens the ability to determine which factors need to be considered for maintenance to occur.

Predictive maintenance allows the factory employees and management to use the analytical applications with rich dashboards that oversee machines' health, providing them with confidence and unlikelihood of the downtimes.

However, even with the adoption of AI in predictive maintenance, determining which diagnostic data should be used for particular types of equipment remains an expensive and time-consuming iteration.

### Conclusion
We can conclude that a successfully deployed predictive maintenance should ensure the following:
- There should be minimal catastrophic failures within a given period, considering the production volumes.
- The overall machine downtimes should be kept at a minimum at all times.
- Most diagnostic work should be automated through machine learning models and Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

There should also be initiatives to ensure that long-lasting solutions have been arrived at for predictive maintenance. Some of the initiatives include:
- Predictive maintenance systems should be accurate and valid. Thorough testing of sensors and iteration testing should be ensured.
- Sensors should be updated and maintained thoroughly. The same should apply to the data flows.
- A detailed user interface should be designed to provide predictions and data streams the users can understand and use to make informed decisions and take intelligent actions.
